# Git Assignment - <Arezookhalili>

a. What is an issue?
    An issue is a way to track tasks, bugs, enhancements, or other types of work related to a project. Issues help manage and organize work within a repository and facilitate collaboration among collaborators

b. What is a pull request?
    A mechanism that allows developers to propose changes to a local computer or codebase. It facilitates the process of reviewing, discussing, and merging changes made in a feature branch into the main branch of a repository. 

c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?
    1. Go to GitHub.com and navigate to the specified GitHub repository.
    2. Find Your Branch, click on the "Pull Requests" tab, then click on "New Pull Request".
    3. Select your branch from the "compare" dropdown and the target branch (main or master) from the "base" dropdown.
    4. GitHub will show the differences between the branches. Review these changes to ensure everything is correct.
    5. Add a Title and Description (any relevant information such as the purpose of the changes, or any related issues) for your pull request. 
    6. Click on "Create Pull Request" to submit it.

d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)
    1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
    2. Open "Settings" from the repository’s main page.
    3. Go to "Collaborators & teams" under the "Access" section.
    4. Add a collaborator by searching for and selecting the user.
    5. Set write permissions and click "Add."
    6. Confirm the collaborator’s access after they accept the invitation.

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
    Git is a Version Control Systemthe which is a tool that manages versions of our code. GitHub is a platform that hosts our Git repositories and provides additional features to facilitate collaboration and project management.

f. What does git diff do?
    It is used for reviewing changes before committing them, understanding differences between branches, and ensuring that our modifications align with our intended updates.

g. What is the main branch?
    The default branch of a repository, where the original and the most stable version of the code is maintained.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
    In some cases such as small projects, we can directly push our changes to "main" branch. But it’s usually recommended to work in a separate branch and use pull requests to keep code quality, collaboration, and stability.
